<p><i><strong>Updated November, 2021!</strong> Fangirls is now based on the successor to Youtube-DL, yt-dlp. It also includes far-better video support, downloading more reliably, and with better progress information. Finally, it allows you to cancel and remove downloads. I was so impressed with myself, I up'd the version to 2.0.</i> üôåüèª</p>

<p>Fangirls is a super-simple front-end to the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><strong>yt-dlp</strong></a> project. In short, it grabs the source of videos you watch on the web, and downloads them to your computer. Despite the name, <strong>yt-dlp</strong> supports vastly more services than YouTube ‚Äî¬†you can <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md">see a full list</a>. It's also a pretty active project; if there's a site that it doesn't work for, the developers are willing to take requests.</p>

<p>One problem with <strong>yt-dlp</strong> is that it's a Python app that you have to use from the command line. I love the command line as much as any card-carrying nerd, but I wanted to build a quick Mac app, and this seemed like a good opportunity. </p>

<p>Here's a picture of Fangirls in action:</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Paste in the URL of a web page that contains a video, and Fangirls will use an included copy of <strong>yt-dlp</strong> to pull the video data from that page and download what it finds. In bullet form, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download videos from the sites that yt-dlp supports;</li>
<li>Choose your download location</li>
<li>...what else do you even need?</li>
</ul>

<a id="why-fangirls" class="anchor" href="#why-fangirls" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why "Fangirls"?</h3>

<p>It's a word my 12-year-old daughter was using a lot when I originally built this, both as a noun and (more entertainingly) a verb. It's interchangeably a derogation and word of praise. And it was on my mind when I sat at the New Project dialogue in Xcode.</p>

<p>Har, har. It was me.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to accept your PRs! Make a fork of this project and shoot me a pull request and let's make Fangirls truly fangirl-worthy.</p>
