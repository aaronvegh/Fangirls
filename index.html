<p>Fangirls is a super-simple front-end to the <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl"><strong>youtube-dl</strong></a> project. In short, it grabs the source of videos you watch on the web, and downloads them to your computer. Despite the name, <strong>youtube-dl</strong> supports vastly more services than YouTube — you can <a href="http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html">see a full list</a>. It's also a pretty active project; if there's a site that it doesn't work for, the developers are willing to take requests.</p>

<p>One problem with <strong>youtube-dl</strong> is that it's a Python app that you have to use from the command line. I love the command line as much as any card-carrying nerd, but I wanted to build a quick Mac app, and this seemed like a good opportunity. </p>

<p>Here's a picture of Fangirls in action:</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>It's pretty bare-bones at this point. Paste in the URL of a web page that contains a video, and Fangirls will use an included copy of <strong>youtube-dl</strong> to pull the video data from that page and download what it finds. In bullet form, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download videos from the sites that youtube-dl supports;</li>
<li>Multiple video-per-page support: it'll show a progress bar for each video it finds;</li>
<li>Choose your download location</li>
<li>...what else do you even need?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="future-considerations" class="anchor" href="#future-considerations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Considerations</h3>

<p>Yeah, actually there's a <em>ton</em> of features in <strong>youtube-dl</strong> that aren't supported in Fangirls. Here's a list of a few that I'd like to implement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show/pick from a list of available formats. While most videos that come down are in Mac-friendly MP4 format, some strange folks upload <em>webm</em>, and that's what you end up with if it's the highest-quality format.</li>
<li>Provide more of the power of <strong>youtube-dl</strong>. I mean, <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#options">just look at all the options</a>. A lot of it is unnecessary for the vast majority of users, but some configuration could be handy to prevent trips to the command line.</li>
<li>UI niceties, like storing the videos you've downloaded, showing the original source page, providing Preferences</li>
<li>A mechanism for updating <strong>youtube-dl</strong> and showing what version it's at. This should really happen in the background.</li>
</ul>

<a id="why-fangirls" class="anchor" href="#why-fangirls" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why "Fangirls"?</h3>

<p>It's a word my 12-year-old daughter is using a lot these days, both as a noun and (more entertainingly) a verb. It's interchangeably a derogation and word of praise. And it was on my mind when I sat at the New Project dialogue in Xcode the other night.</p>

<p>Har, har. It was me.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to accept your PRs! Make a fork of this project and shoot me a pull request and let's make Fangirls truly fangirl-worthy.</p>
